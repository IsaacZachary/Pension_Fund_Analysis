## Overview

This project aims to model the growth of pension funds in Kenya using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and analyze the impact of external factors on this growth. The specific objectives are:

1. **To forecast the growth of pension funds in Kenya using the ARIMA model.**
2. **To analyze the impact of external factors on the growth of pension funds.**

## Solution

### Objective 1: Forecasting Pension Fund Growth

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    - Pension contribution data, inflation rates, and central bank rates for 2022 and 2023 are loaded from Excel files.
    - The pension contribution data is extracted and converted into a time series object.
2. **Simulating Pension Data:**
    - An ARIMA model is fitted to the existing pension contribution data to capture its underlying pattern.
    - The ARIMA model is then used to forecast the pension data for the years 2024 and 2025, extending it to a total of 48 observations.
    - The simulated pension data is plotted to visualize the forecasted growth.

### Objective 2: Analyzing Impact of External Factors

**Steps:**

3. **Fitting Distributions for External Factors:**
    - Central bank rates (CBR) and inflation rates are extracted and converted into time series objects.
    - Distributions are fitted to the CBR and inflation rate data to match the length of the pension data.
4. **Regression Analysis:**
    - The pension data, along with the simulated CBR and inflation rate data, are combined into a data frame.
    - A regression model is constructed with the pension data as the dependent variable and the CBR and inflation rate as independent variables.
    - The regression model is fitted and summarized to analyze the impact of external factors on the growth of pension funds.
    - The regression results are plotted to visualize the relationship between the actual pension contributions and the fitted values.

## Results

- **Pension Data Forecast (2022-2027):**
    - The ARIMA model forecasts the growth of pension funds up to 2027, showing an increasing trend over time.
